# Instructions on Running Experiments

## Environment Setup

## Fast-dLLM

The fast-dllm baseline uses v2_1.5 weights.

Need to clone weights from hf, replace remote, and plug in our own generate.py with efficient generate mechanisms for using dLLMs as spec decoding drafters

## EAGLE-3

We use specforge; we are still in the process of training; will add more docs and release weights
